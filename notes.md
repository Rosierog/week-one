# week-one
- many of the instructions I had to go over a few times as Iam not familiar with this field of study, some of the terminology stumped me

GitHub: I recreated the week one files a few times as I was learning how to use the application
- Explored https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ as posted by a classmate, would like to revisit when I have a better understanding of digital history

Zotero: I experienced some issues downloading articles
I used the following link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg25gHIQpyk to help with adding articles 

- any questions I had were asked and answered through Discord
- did not use any codes for these exercises

DEMO HELP REQUEST: I understand the purpose of this put unsure how to demo it ? 

HYPOTHESIS: It was interesting to read peers annotations and opinions on the readings
