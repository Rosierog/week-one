# week-onePodcasts
 - Engaging and interesting content, I enjoyed the perspective of failure and the uncommon practice of examing failure in a academic setting i.e. univerisities
 
 NOTE: anxious to deal with the more technical side of this course 

Zotero
 
 	- was fairly easy to download; had a few issues opening up the application the first time but found success
	- The tutuorials pertaining to it were very helpful
	- will explore the application and more, aswell as would like to like to use for further research papers it seems an ideal location to organize papers and research as oppose to keeping many tabs open when writing a paper


GITUP
  - this was the first application I created an account for, the instructions and pics were very useful
  - confusion with how to format 

Discord
- Easy to download and set up account 
- this forum allows for an easy communication with the people in the class; i like how there is a social section to that creates a more human interaction as opposed to only focused on class work 
- effective way to ask questions and see where other students struggled and how they went about fixing the issueor learning from other students

Before DIGHIST

Prior to this course I never put a lot of thought into digital history. In the context of any part of history, 
for most eras we are learning events as they happened in the past and their influence on the world. Digital history, 
is still new and has a short history in comparison to other historical events. Through the readings and listening to the podcast
it is easy to see that like much of history it is told from a man's view/world, prominent women and their success' to the field are not 
accreddited in the same way. Digitial history is also a lot of trial and errorr, failures, road blocks and finding for effective ways of accomplishing goals
